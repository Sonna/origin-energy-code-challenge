# Origin Energy - ðŸ§ª Take Home Challenge

> Build a React + Node.js application that renders a customer's energy accounts
> and allows a user to make a credit card payment.

## Package - NPM Scripts

_You will need to run `npm install` to install dependencies before running the
app. This assumes you have Node.js installed and setup in your PATH_

- `npm start`/`npm run start`

  Starts the compiled app server (need to run `npm run build` before this
  script)

- `npm run build`

  Builds both the server and frontend apps

- `npm run test`

  Run Jest test suite

- `npm run test:cypress`/`npm run test:cypress-gui`

  Run separate Cypress tests, in headless or GUI modes respectively.

  You will need to navigate to the `./integration` directory first to install
  Cypress dependency first (it's separate to the main app).

- `npm run lint`

  Runs ESLint rules + TypeScript type checking

- `npm run format`

  Formats the app using Prettier

- `npm run generate-types`

  This generates the OpenAPI types from the backend for use within the React
  app. Server must be running first.

  + OpenAPI schema can be accessed http://localhost:8080/openapi.json
  + Swagger web UI can be accessed http://localhost:8080/docs

## TODOs:

- Finish building out the Design System and rip out the PaperCSS dependency. I
  would look at either writing my own stylesheets, CSS-in-JS (like
  styled-components) or maybe try something like Tailwind

- I lost an embrassing amount of time to just fixing the build tools. Not happy
  with the current Vite solution and use Parcel or might reassess just using
  Babel with Webpack ðŸ˜•

- Add a `/?reset` path to the server to make re-running the Cypress tests, but
  requires locking down

- Improve tests overall:

  + There are date/time validations not mocked out
  + Add a `mockRequest` & `mockResponse` object since adding `any` causes the
    linter to complain and I want to keep that linting rule

- Might separate the `client` & `server` code more, but the majority of the
  server code is living in the `./src/api` directory so ðŸ¤·

- Maybe fix the React Query SSR, didn't work for some reason, so I ended up
  ripping it out
